            <h5>Vision Zero</h5>
                <p>Imagine a world where no one dies from car accidents every 20 seconds.
                You call us dreamer, we call it:

                But what is Vision Zero?
                For too long, we’ve considered traffic deaths and severe injuries to be inevitable side effects of modern life. While often referred to as “accidents”, the reality is that we can prevent these tragedies by taking a proactive and preventative approach that prioritizes traffic safety as a public health issue.
                We, at FellowBot unleash the potentials of Virtual Reality to contribute to Vision Zero:
                safer streets, sustainable mobility and efficient environment planning.
